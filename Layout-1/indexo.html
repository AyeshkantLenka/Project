    <h2>CULTURAL ACTIVITIES</h2>
    <p class="paraedit">Today’s education system is not just confined to academics but modern-day schools focus on imparting skills to students like personality development, confidence building, communication skills, etiquettes, etc. Cultural
      activities come into play in instilling these skills in the students.Encouraging students to participate in cultural activities is the most effective way to inculcate personality-related skills. Unfortunately, many parents and students find
      these activities as total waste of time and energy. However, the truth is entirely different as cultural activities enable students to gain confidence and understand their culture in a much better way. </p>
